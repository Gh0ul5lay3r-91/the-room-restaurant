# The Room Restaurant

## Introduction

This web application is design to allow a user to book a table at The Room Restaurant. The user will have to log in to allow them to book a table and male the process of booking a table easier. The web application also allows for the restaurant themselves to create an admin or superuser, to manage all bookings either creating them or deleting them. This application allows you to book a table for a specific time slot whilst checking the table isnt booked already.

Whilst researching for this project I looked at other restaurant websites to see what layouts where being used. Interviewed some people and asked what they would expect from a table booking website. The target audience is users of all ages male and female, those looking to ensure they have a table in the restaurant and those who know what food they are likely to have. 

Opportunities where decided by taking the customer needs and the business needs
